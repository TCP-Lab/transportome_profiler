    The transportome, the -omic layer encompassing all ion channels and transportes (ICTs), is crucial for cell physiology.
    It is therefore possible to hypothesize a role of the transportome in disease, and in particular in cancer.
    Here, we present the Membrane Transport Protein database (MTP-db), a database collecting information on ICTs, and a pipeline to take expression data and the MTP-db as input and produce a broad overview over the disregulated transportome in cancer.
    The MTP-DB may prove useful for the study of the transportome in general, and the pipeline may be used to study the transportome in other diseases.
    Both tools are open source and can be found on Github at \href{https://github.com/TCP-Lab/MTP-db}{TCP-Lab/mtp-db} and \href{https://github.com/TCP-Lab/transportome_profiler}{TCP-Lab/transportome\_profiler}, under permissive licenses.
    We detect that the transportome is disregulated in cancer, and that dysregulation patterns are shared between different cancer types.
    It is still unclear how these disregulation patterns are linked with cancer physiology.
