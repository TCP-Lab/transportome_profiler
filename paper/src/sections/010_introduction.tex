% Define "transportome"

We therefore aimed at profiling the expression levels of Transportome genes in
the context of cancer. To do this, we collected information on these genes (such
as their complete list, which molecule they transport, their gating mechanism,
their functional class, etc.) and used it to systematically arrange them into
meaningful \glspl{tgl}. After sorting all the protein-coding genes found in
cancer cells based on their differential expression with respect to healthy
cells, we run a pre-ranked \gls{gsea} on these ordered lists to obtain
enrichment scores for every \gls{tgl}.
