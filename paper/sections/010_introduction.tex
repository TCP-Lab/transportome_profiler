% Define "transportome"

We therefore aimed to profile the expression levels of Transportome genes in the context of cancer. To do this, we collected information of these genes (such as their complete list, which molecule they transported, their functional class, etc...) and used it to systematically separate them into meaningful \glspl{tgl}. By sorting all expressed genes in cancer cells based on their differential expression with % Do NOT change this to 'in', you did it six times already and always went back to 'with'.
respect of healthy cells, we could run \gls{gsea} on these ordered lists to obtain enrichment values for every \gls{tgl}.
